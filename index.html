          What if there was a personal power program that could do ALL of this

          Hi, my name's Leslie, the creator and founder of Explorations with
          Leslie Tanner, the most effective personal power program in the
          country. For decades, I have travelled from coast to coast delivering
          seminars, one-on-one coaching sessions, and hosting my landmark
          call-in show. Through this, I've worked with THOUSANDS of people just
          like you, from the biggest “losers” you could imagine to the “titans”
          of industry or “experts” of virtually every field. Through the
          countless hours of live weekend-long seminars and individual coaching,
          I have put together The “Final” Program, so to speak: the most
          COMPLETE and EFFECTIVE personal power program that has ever been
          created. A revolutionary framework by which each individual is able to
          fundamentally understand THEMSELVES, the WORLD around them, and
          TRANSFORM any and every area of their life using a UNIVERSAL POWER
          that has lied dormant in their mind and body and spirit for as long as
          they've existed.

          Isn't it time you tap into your true power and live the life you've
          always deserved? Isn't it time for you truly BECOME and UNLEASH The
          Power of The Next-Next Level?
        </p>

          Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life…welcome to

        If you've made it this far, I'm sure you're asking yourself, “Ok, sounds
        good, but what IS the program?” So, the best and most effective way to
        understand exactly what this program is, its simple yet profound tools
        and how to put them to use in YOUR life, is to attend the LIVE call-in
        show or a weekend seminar where thousands of people hungry for a change
        in their life gather to TRANSFORM their lives through a healthy mixture
        of humor, play, community, and good old-fashioned WORK. However, below
        I've assembled some of key ideas upon which Explorations is based so
        that you can start reaping the benefits of the LIFE-CHANGING tools right
        away! (Check back regularly for updates and new posts!)

        Ladies and gentlemen, we live in what I'm sure most of us would consider
        a chaotic world: instability and decay define much of our lives on both
        the short and long term, while it wasn't that long ago that it felt like
        ANYTHING was possible. From planes to space travel, from telephone to
        instant video calls, from religious mystery and oppression to knowledge
        and freedom, all within the span of a few decades. This period of growth
        came on the heels of millenia upon millenia of relative stability and
        stagnancy. It was intoxicating, to say the least, for everyone during
        these periods of grow, and, as a result, we were promised that the
        fruits of the richest time in human history were products of hard work
        and would be ours as well, given we follow in their footsteps and trust
        their understanding of the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, as wild and varied of a group of people we are, you could point to
        many things that bind us together here at Explorations, one of which
        being the knowledge that this idea of perpetual and uniform abundance
        and success is bullshit. As the world around us continues to
        disintegrate and transform into forms we no longer recognize, we see
        beyond their broken promises to the universal constant of ambivalent,
        rapacious change. Another thing that binds us together is the knowledge
        that Explorations, the most power personal program in the world, is that
        way for a reason. It does not run from the violence that we can see all
        around us and inside of us, and further yet seeks to leverage the
        reality of it to harness the true power that courses through each of our
        veins.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this, we, the Explorers, find ourselves in a position of
        tremendous responsibility. As the world continues to disintegrate and
        pervert itself around us, we alone have the tools by which to unlock
        human potential, but we also solely possess the perspective to
        acknowledge, define, and navigate nothing short of a new historical
        paradigm…
      </p>

      <p>
        The physical scientists of the mid-20th century, following unprecedented
        leaps and achievements in knowledge since The Enlightenment, once
        described human beings as, "The Universe observing itself." While this
        was a cute way to phrase it, and inspiring in a
        Chicken-Soup-for-the-Toll-Booth-Operator's-Soul kind of way, this relic
        of "objectivity" is an artifact of privilege and riches, as is clearer
        to us, today. The notion that we could simply “observe” the universe in
        order to “understand” it is a naive, childish heirloom that, while this
        Age of Reason and Progress should be credited for the achievements it
        fostered, should also be mercilessly criticized for the arrogance and
        psychic defenses it provided for mankind as it emotionally suppressed
        tremendous flaws and morally laundered some of the worst man-made
        calamaties we've ever known.
      </p>

      <p>(“We are the universe observing itself.” - Carl Sagan (pic))</p>

      <p>2</p>

      <p>
        Around the same time this declaration was made, another school of
        thought emerged with a slightly different take. Unimpressed by what it
        saw as short-sightedness of “objectivity” as it was being employed by
        the sciences, some thought leaders and their disciples began a movement
        informed by a wider perspective declared a “New Age,” one in which human
        beings were “The Universe experiencing itself.” Like the sciences above,
        this “New Age” group should be credited for its attempts to further the
        shortcomings of science by integrating certain facets of human
        subjectivity while attempting to unlock a wider view of human potential.
        However, like the sciences, it must also be mercilessly criticized for
        its understandable but ultimately pathetic half-measures, its ignorant
        lust for “transcendence” or “liberation,” and the tragic violence done
        in its name to this day.
      </p>

      <p>(“We are the universe experiencing itself.” - Alan Watts (pic))</p>

      <p>
        We, amidst the godless, neurotic sense of “progress” and the pathetic
        attempts to hold at bay the profound destruction through “progress” to
        somewhere or “conservation” of something, we stand at an immense end of
        the present moment. As we continue to watch each other, ourselves, and
        the “shared reality” that once held us and our experiences together, let
        us call out to anyone with ears to hear to declare this paradigm of
        disintegration and death as The New-New Age. As we here at Explorations
        go forth and open our mouths to share the Bad News, may our voices be
        absorbed into the encroaching nothingness all around us as we declare,
        “We are not the Universe observing itself, nor simply experiencing
        itself; as the commotion of being gives way to eternal silence, we are
        the universe tolerating, enduring, and destroying itself.”
      </p>

      <p>(“We are the universe enduring itself.” - Leslie (pic))</p>

      <p>
        Now you might be asking, Now what? Well, this is where we, as Explorers,
        are in a tremendous position. I have built this program from the ground
        up based on this reality, that we are enduring in a very real sense, the
        end times. For our Exploration tonight, allow me to ask all of you, “How
        can we leverage our and everything's inevitable end to Truly Become? How
        may we sift through the actively disintegrating fragments of a reality
        we believed to be stable, to find who we are, what we were truly meant
        to become, and live a life, however short, that we've only ever dreamed
        of?
