          Hi, my name's Leslie, the creator and founder of Explorations with
          Leslie Tanner, the most effective personal power program in the
          country. For decades, I have travelled from coast to coast delivering
          seminars, one-on-one coaching sessions, and hosting my landmark
          call-in show. Through this, I've worked with THOUSANDS of people just
          like you, from the biggest “losers” you could imagine to the “titans”
          of industry or “experts” of virtually every field. Through the
          countless hours of live weekend-long seminars and individual coaching,
          I have put together The “Final” Program, so to speak: the most
          COMPLETE and EFFECTIVE personal power program that has ever been
          created. A revolutionary framework by which each individual is able to
          fundamentally understand THEMSELVES, the WORLD around them, and
          TRANSFORM any and every area of their life using a UNIVERSAL POWER
          that has lied dormant in their mind and body and spirit for as long as
          they've existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isn't it time you tap into your true power and live the life you've
          always deserved? Isn't it time for you truly BECOME and UNLEASH The
          Power of The Next-Next Level?
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life…welcome to
          Explorations!

        If you've made it this far, I'm sure you're asking yourself, “Ok, sounds
        good, but what IS the program?” So, the best and most effective way to
        understand exactly what this program is, its simple yet profound tools
        and how to put them to use in YOUR life, is to attend the LIVE call-in
        show or a weekend seminar where thousands of people hungry for a change
        in their life gather to TRANSFORM their lives through a healthy mixture
        of humor, play, community, and good old-fashioned WORK. However, below
        I've assembled some of key ideas upon which Explorations is based so
        that you can start reaping the benefits of the LIFE-CHANGING tools right
        away! (Check back regularly for updates and new posts!)

        As there is always much left to “explore” even among the 4 tenets, this
        meditation, however, is designed to serve as a baseline, a palette
        cleanser, a splash of tonic after the many faceted journeys that one can
        take through or within Explorations. You see, part of the reason
        Explorations has been such an effective personal power program, is its
        universality. Anyone with a pulse and an ability to hear and form simple
        sentences can tap into their innate potential because the tools I've
        created for you are simple. Relax, Question, Express, and Explore. While
        many have made mountains out of mole hills, and others mole hills out of
        their mountains, ha ha, one will always be faced with that which the
        program is designed to access: reality, nothing more, nothing less. By
        now, you have seen how successful The Program has been with people from
        all walks of life regardless of race, religion, age, or abilities, and
        to witness this firsthand as you all have can be overwhelming. Ha,
        sometimes it's almost overwhelming for me, and it would be if I didn't
        have absolute faith in not just Explorations, but you all as well, my
        Explorers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin our meditation on “The Beauty of Nature,” I'll start with a
        question. One of the questions I get asked most by those newly
        interested in getting started in the program is something to the effect
        of, “How do you communicate to so many different people?” The answer is
        simple, albeit not very gratifying. While I would love to take credit
        for being some genius guru, some angelic figure who is able to
        communicate in a way that transcends language, the answer is really just
        that people are people. Our experiences, while they may look different
        on the surface, are actually much, much more profoundly similar than we
        would like to think. If there has been one difficulty that has marked my
        experience in creating this program, it has been the same one many of
        you struggle with on a constant basis: of seeing yourself in others,
        others in yourself, following the path of this reality wherever it
        leads, and fully drawing the consequences of this journey. Many
        religions and belief systems like to appeal to this idea in their pitch
        for support, as I'm sure you can think of some now. Buddhists professing
        the unreality of the self, Christians preaching that we are all the lamb
        children of God, The Father and Creator, Jews that all humans are made
        in God's image… or modern scientists extolling that we are united in the
        truth that we are all simply “star stuff,” as the late, great Carl Sagan
        phrased it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, while these historic and profound ideas have a dimension of truth
        to them, the truth, in this situation, is not the problem. The problem
        is that these frameworks of thought and belief are doomed to the same
        fate: to eventually become defined by that which they are defended
        against, their anathema, their antithesis…Their Other and their
        inability to integrate it within themselves. Instead of this
        excruciating process of metaphysical suicide that we prefer here, at
        Explorations, they opt for the same thing humans always do: some sort of
        divine, eternal war against some Other, substituting the blunt,
        annihilating travesty of being for the euphoria of some tepid
        pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be fair, on some level, all human beings sense this inherent conflict
        at the core of nature and are tempted, time and time again, to write,
        produce, direct, and then consume some version of this pornography; one
        in which we all star in our own narrative as a classic victim/champion
        of old, always in possession of the means by which Evil is subdued, and
        the best of all possible futures is built. For the vast majority of
        humanity lost in this delusion, the reality we acknowledge through
        Explorations is so terrifying, so overwhelming that it must remain
        mostly, if not wholly, unconscious, as does their true potential, the
        power of The Next-Next Level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right about now, you might be wondering what this has to do with some
        trees and rivers, ha ha. Well, I wanted to make sure that this principle
        of Explorations is fresh in all of your minds, today: The principle of
        The Calamity of Truth, or The Truth of Calamity, whichever you prefer.
        In our pursuit of the power of The Next-Next Level we speak about so
        frequently at Explorations, the integration of all being in our
        perception of reality must by definition include that which is
        non-includable, and that very much is applicable to “nature,” the
        ultimate test of this principle. Now, for most of humanity in the modern
        world, nature invokes a sense of peace, calm, a respite from the
        conflict and dissonance that stalks us in our daily lives, all the while
        deeply repressing the unnerving conflict at nature's core. Rather than
        embracing the power of this dissonance through easily observed phenomena
        such as suicide, starvation, schizophrenia, infanticide, rape, or even
        just the mundanity of any of these things, most choose to use this
        constructed specter of “nature” as any other perverted thing, as a
        defense against that which they seek to embrace.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, whether you're reading this for the first, second, or umpteenth
        time, allow the Beauty of Nature to reveal itself to you in your life
        today. What I mean is to allow the Beauty of Nature to take on that
        which destroys itself in the process, Nature's “other”. Allow your mind
        to explore the layers of nature, gradually uncovering that which you,
        yourself, are defended against: the inconvenient, the detestable, the
        hideous, the “unnatural”. As you endure your meditation today, your
        thoughts and feelings regarding nature will indeed evolve, and as with
        any evolution, this will include the death of many of these thoughts and
        feelings. If you begin this process from a place of comfort, these small
        deaths will be accompanied by discomfort. If you are beginning this
        process from a place of unrest and listlessness, you will experience
        these small deaths as abatement and relaxation. Allow the back-and-forth
        of rest and unrest to evolve in your heart and mind, as this is the path
        of The Next-Next Level we speak about so frequently at Exploration.
        Namaste.

      <h3 class="writing-subheading">Understanding and Non-Understanding</h3>
      <p>
        In my travels and experiences, many “wise men” have urged me to push
        through and see beyond binary thinking, telling me that the division is
        only an illusion, that it's somehow my fault that I'm stuck there, and
        that if I try hard enough, if I study enough, if I pray enough, if I
        meditate enough…I will somehow transcend my primitive black-white
        thinking and… I never completely understood…ascend into a realm of
        post-knowledge?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are things we know, and there are things we don't know. This may
        seem obvious, but it's important to remember how profound of a reality
        this is. Every single sentient being that's ever lived, from land to sea
        since the cursed dawn of awareness sparked ablaze on our little blue
        marble, has been faced with this basic dichotomy and has been forced to
        engage in the reality of it in order to survive. When people ask me how
        powerful this program can be, a lot of the time I simply ask them: how
        scared are you of what lies outside of your vision? Put another way:
        what is your relationship with the unknown? The border between these two
        disparate realism and how we relate to it stand at the most fundamental
        level of our consciousness, arguably the reason we developed
        consciousness in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we approach each of our limits we must accept the criteria by which
        the border extends or contracts. Many emotions arise during this process
        which MUST be included in the process and criteria of furthering our
        understanding. Not the least of which is an acceptin gof the criteria by
        which our understanding is derived and therefore limited. True for every
        framework that mankind has ever used to attempt to perceive, grasp, and
        navigate being, is that each framework will produce its signature
        methods of generating and limiting its own understanding. The acceptance
        fo the specific metaphysical lens by which self, other, and shared
        reality is experienced should be accompanied with an overwhelming sense
        of grief and mourning; knowing that while you seek to close the gap
        between self and other, whatever IT may be, you will never truly achieve
        it, until the final moment of defeat and annihilation, at which point
        you will truly be EXPLORING.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explorations is not here to substitute a version of religion for
        science, science for religion, or refine the clarity of either. It's
        actually quite the opposite. If this program is successful, it is an
        explicit process of radicalization: radicalized to become, to put it
        simply, yourself. You see, every framework for understanding attempts to
        tackle the same, most basic phenomena every human being who has ever
        existed is forced to experience and attempt to navigate. Self, Other,
        and Shared Reality. Whether Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, or the
        most dyed in the wool atheistic scientist, social worker or philosopher,
        we are essentially presented with the same set of experiences and tools
        by which to make sense of them, a fluxing tide of invention and
        discovery, known and unknown, tangible and ethereal.

      <h3 class="writing-subheading">Sands of Innovation, Waves of Tomorrow</h3>
      <p>
        As I awake in the morning and I say yes to the universe, I am confronted
        by that whch I am saying yes to. Assaulted. Overwhelmed. I say that I
        say yes, but ultimately it is not that I have a choice. There is no
        break or respite, no way to detach, disconnect, or truly dissociate. But
        there is also no way to engage in a way that maintains agency or
        integrity of any kind. I say that I say yes, but the experience I say
        yes to washes over me in spite of my will, in spite of my “yes' or “no”.
        It is so totalizing, so overwhelming that it's difficult to say if there
        is a me that experiences the universe in the first place. The dissonance
        of the experience, it obliterates that false pretenses on which I
        believed I said yes or no, but in so doing creates the context of a yes
        or no to follow, a self, if you can still call it that. My self.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this intersection of experience and being, language falters. The
        words we use to describe this excruciating nexus begin to fall apart and
        eventually disintegrate because they are born posteriori by the thing
        that they wish to describe, that is after the fact. To look into the
        mouth of God, there is no language, no resolution, no understanding to
        be had, and there is no answer to this except for desperation,
        despondence, alienation. Should we near the present moment in our
        journey together and feel a sense of elation, we should immediately and
        violently abandon said path with extreme prejudice. Our friends and
        family walking alongside us dispatched. “Connection” and “unification”
        bring a poison into our lives, more potent than we could possibly dream
        of.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may seem rash, but I say this out of the most profound sense of
        love for not just you, but every human being I come across. I look in
        their eyes, and I see a vast ocean of suffering, anger, sadness and
        frustration put everywhere except where it belongs, the present moment.
        Religious vigor wasted in the church, political anger wasted at the
        polls, scientific vigor wasted in our schools and universities. The
        dissonance of being acts upon me as an ultrasound, disintegrating the
        false, craggy defenses I have between me and being, me and reality, me
        and the next next level, removing falsities and leaving what is left. It
        is at this point I am able to think. I am able to act. I am able to love
        and hate. I may act in any arena of human life no tas a fearful,
        castrated man of modernity, but as an artifact of a castration so
        profound it evades language, as a temporal fragment of resonance. Only
        by allowing the universe to shake away these layers of falsity, by
        allowing the universe to act upon us in spite of our saying “yes” or
        “no”, will we truly unlock and unleash our true potential of The Next
        Next level.

      <h3 class="writing-subheading">The Power of Spite</h3>
      <p>
        I knew a young man, angry, sad, and darkly depressed. He came into his
        weekly session with me, and I could tell we had finally arrived at a
        crossroads. We had been working up to this moment for months and months,
        patiently parsing through his superficial, surface-level problems,
        money, relationships, job, what he's doing with his life, etc. I could
        tell right away, however, that his case was similar to the problem I see
        with nearly every person I work with, regardless of age, culture,
        gender, or anything else that distinguishes us from one another, this
        young man's problem was just about as profound and universal as it gets:
        whether to continue living or not. This is his story, one of an infinite
        number of examples in which spite can empower each of us to unleash The
        Power of The Next-Next Level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beginning of our time working together, much of it was filled with
        relatively superficial conversation, but as time increased, the
        suppression of emotions relaxed as it normally does. As our conversation
        grew less superficial, though, the time we spent together grew
        increasingly silent, the gaps in conversation broken up with
        intermittent allusions to being “so tired” or just wanting it “to stop”.
        So during our final session together, we began sitting in silence for
        nearly the entire duration. The silence we spent with each other that
        day was anything but empty though. I knew what he was feeling, and he
        knew that I knew, an unbearable pressure, an encroaching point of
        inevitability that we had worked diligently to uncover and bring about.
        For as dark as he was, the silence itself took on a glow in and of
        itself, and as our time came to a close, I simply bid him a, “good
        luck,” and through moistened eyes, he grabbed his coat and left my
        office. After much work, we arrived at his Crossroads alone, together…
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, as he would later describe to me, he sat naked in a bathtub
        with any manner of methods of “concluding his sojourn with
        Explorations,” so to speak. He stared at them on the ledge of the filthy
        tub, alternating his focus between the bye-bye tools and his soft, wet,
        pale body. He would pick one up, prod and pinch at his body, and think
        and feel what there was to think or feel. As he Explored his mind and
        body in that moment, he found himself fully immersed in the process of
        the future approaching, becoming the present for a perpetually
        excruciating and terrifying moment of near total defeat, only to recede
        into a past that disintegrated more quickly than it could be accounted.
        Finally, with a damp steak knife in his hand, he described to me
        noticing something small that pushed him past his Final Threshold: the
        water pouring from the bath's faucet was now cold. The Final Threshold
        had been breached, inevitability set in motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see, his disgusting tub and the time he regularly spent in it were
        his final moments of reprieve from a very bleak monotony, the final
        weight-bearing wall of his internal life, and he had brought up in
        session nearly every week, the exhausting back-and-forth with his
        landlord about getting this goddamn-ass fucking piece of fucking dogshit
        water heater fixed. Messages, calls, emails, little stops in his office,
        only ever to be shrugged off or placated, to which I only ever responded
        by stoking the growing fire, “That would upset me too, I might even do
        something extreme.” That night, as he sat there for what could just as
        easily have been his final moments alive, an overwhelming, unconscious
        rage would take hold of his mind, transforming his body from a place of
        loathing and decay, to a kinetic vessel of spiritual electricity. As if
        possessed, he now looked upon the tools of self-destruction with
        disdain, shoving them off the tub's ledge, rose out of the tepid water
        and broke his hand while trying to punch a hole in the drywall nearby.
        However, rather than fueling the sense of defeat that nearly took his
        life, the splintered bones in his hand only fomented the kindling
        flames. The rage he held for those that inflicted this cold water on him
        would reshape his life from that point on. Stalking, harassing,
        assaulting his landlord and those that worked in the office, he from
        then on carried a boundless, sleepless energy devoted to ruining the
        life of those who dismissed the few final threads by which his life
        clung. As he wrote to me in a letter from prison, he eventually didn't
        even care whether any water was ever warm again, describing a clarifying
        attachment to cold, tepid, stagnant water from then on. Through the
        power of spite, he Truly Became himself that night.
      </p>
      <p>
        As inspiring as this is, this is but one story, however, in an infinite
        number of ways spite can and should be used as a tool for our physical,
        mental, and spiritual health. As any of our brothers and sisters
        surviving off the grid will tell you, having a means by which fire may
        be easily and kindled, stoked, and allowed to spread can be the
        difference between life and death.. So, in light of the transformational
        power of this profound yet ancient spiritual tool, let's ask ourselves,
        tonight:
        <b>
          How might I use the desire to antagonize, annoy, or offend someone to
          truly Become Myself? What are some useful, reliable sources of spite
          in our own lives?</b

        Origin of The Power of The Next-Next Level
      </h3>
      <p>
        To get the idea of how Explorations works and the level of POWER I'm
        going teach you to access, we need to have some kind of understanding of
        WHAT this power is and WHERE it comes from in the first place. Now, one
        thing that makes this program so effective for so many different kinds
        of people, is that Explorations is built on a very simple, some might
        say ancient premise, acknowledged by religious and scientific leaders
        all over the world for thousands of years: that YOU are the UNIVERSE.
        You may have heard this before, or this sentence may sound simplistic
        and cliche, but allow me to elaborate and provide some perspective
        because the RESULTS could alter the course of your life…
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to provide a proper context for The Power of The Next-Next
        Level that we speak about so frequently here at Explorations, come with
        me while we travel back in time, ha. Let's rewind the clock…all the way
        back to the beginning…of everything. That's right, the beginning of
        everything in which “anything” emerged, separating itself from
        “nothing”. This moment in which space, time, matter or energy, breached
        the threshold of reality and began its existence, was an undeniably
        MOMENTOUS occasion, birthing literally everything that ever was, is, or
        will be. Every atom, molecule, star, or planet; every plant, animal, or
        human being; every tool, technology, or invention that has ever been or
        will ever come to be, began at this very moment. Since this time, the
        universe has kept on, well, being, and while it's been at it, it's
        insisted on continually EXPANDING and ORGANIZING itself. From
        nothingness, being began, and thus began the long, journey through
        immeasurable time and infinite combinations…all the way to this moment,
        to you and me, right here and now, as I write this sentence and you read
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've traveled the world to share the program of Explorations, I've
        had the privilege and honor with working with many different kinds of
        people, but along the way I've noticed some trends. Normally, after I
        tell someone what I just shared with you, I receive one of two
        responses, and while the exact percentage can vary based on external
        factors, overall it splits pretty evenly. The first one is one of
        elation and excitement. To be reminded that you are part of the
        universe, but a single, conscious node in a vast network of existence
        that exists in time and space, but also made of the same stuff that
        necessitated the creation of time and space to begin with, wow. And on
        top of that, that they have as much of a RIGHT to tap into this POWER as
        anyone that has ever existed…you can understand why someone might be
        excited! Then, there's the other camp. Rather than excitement and
        enthusiasm that they are part of this universe, after I ask them how
        they feel about this truth of the universe, they shyly start telling me
        how small and insignificant they feel. Thinking about the MASSIVE forces
        moving through and around them, they feel as small as a bug about to be
        crushed and wiped from the memory of everything. Weak and insignificant,
        they see the details of their lives rendered redundant, small, and
        pointless. You can understand why someone might feel this way too!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, it might seem funny to you, but during this talk that I have with
        groups of thousands at one of my seminars or in a one-on-one coaching
        session, and I hear their reactions of energized enthusiasm or profound
        woe, I actually have the same answer, and I want everyone to listen very
        closely because this is possibly the most important facet of
        Explorations, a principle upon which everything that you're going to
        learn is founded. The answer that I give to everyone regardless of their
        emotional reaction to The Bad News: “Yes.” … Yes! Of course! As each of
        you dip your toe into the water of The Next-Next Level, you will have
        different reactions, but I'm here to tell you that they are correct!
        This ENERGY and POWER I'm going to teach you to unlock, this SOURCE
        POWER that drives the very EXISTENCE of anything that can or will ever
        be, it is unlike anything you've ever experienced before and WILL, not
        MIGHT, it WILL change your life forever. Is this good? For many, yes!
        You're not here because your lives are great, you're here to change. But
        like any change, is it also going to be BAD? YOU BET.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be in touch with the ancient yet profound power of The Next-Next
        Level is to be in touch not just with good, not just with bad, but to
        become ONE with the animating force that creates each, that creates you,
        that necessitates anything and everything. The origin of The Power of
        The Next-Next Level will show you the “you” that you've barely allowed
        yourself to dream of and whisper to yourself, but it is also the source
        of not just dissonance, not just anguish, but of an annihilating
        preconscious storm that will call all of its children home in the end.

      <h2>Welcome to The New-New Age</h2>
      <p>
        Ladies and gentlemen, we live in what I'm sure most of us would consider
        a chaotic world: instability and decay define much of our lives on both
        the short and long term, while it wasn't that long ago that it felt like
        ANYTHING was possible. From planes to space travel, from telephone to
        instant video calls, from religious mystery and oppression to knowledge
        and freedom, all within the span of a few decades. This period of growth
        came on the heels of millenia upon millenia of relative stability and
        stagnancy. It was intoxicating, to say the least, for everyone during
        these periods of grow, and, as a result, we were promised that the
        fruits of the richest time in human history were products of hard work
        and would be ours as well, given we follow in their footsteps and trust
        their understanding of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, as wild and varied of a group of people we are, you could point to
        many things that bind us together here at Explorations, one of which
        being the knowledge that this idea of perpetual and uniform abundance
        and success is bullshit. As the world around us continues to
        disintegrate and transform into forms we no longer recognize, we see
        beyond their broken promises to the universal constant of ambivalent,
        rapacious change. Another thing that binds us together is the knowledge
        that Explorations, the most power personal program in the world, is that
        way for a reason. It does not run from the violence that we can see all
        around us and inside of us, and further yet seeks to leverage the
        reality of it to harness the true power that courses through each of our
        veins.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this, we, the Explorers, find ourselves in a position of
        tremendous responsibility. As the world continues to disintegrate and
        pervert itself around us, we alone have the tools by which to unlock
        human potential, but we also solely possess the perspective to
        acknowledge, define, and navigate nothing short of a new historical
        paradigm…
      </p>

      <p>
        The physical scientists of the mid-20th century, following unprecedented
        leaps and achievements in knowledge since The Enlightenment, once
        described human beings as, "The Universe observing itself." While this
        was a cute way to phrase it, and inspiring in a
        Chicken-Soup-for-the-Toll-Booth-Operator's-Soul kind of way, this relic
        of "objectivity" is an artifact of privilege and riches, as is clearer
        to us, today. The notion that we could simply “observe” the universe in
        order to “understand” it is a naive, childish heirloom that, while this
        Age of Reason and Progress should be credited for the achievements it
        fostered, should also be mercilessly criticized for the arrogance and
        psychic defenses it provided for mankind as it emotionally suppressed
        tremendous flaws and morally laundered some of the worst man-made
        calamaties we've ever known.
      </p>

      <p>(“We are the universe observing itself.” - Carl Sagan (pic))</p>

      <p>2</p>

      <p>
        Around the same time this declaration was made, another school of
        thought emerged with a slightly different take. Unimpressed by what it
        saw as short-sightedness of “objectivity” as it was being employed by
        the sciences, some thought leaders and their disciples began a movement
        informed by a wider perspective declared a “New Age,” one in which human
        beings were “The Universe experiencing itself.” Like the sciences above,
        this “New Age” group should be credited for its attempts to further the
        shortcomings of science by integrating certain facets of human
        subjectivity while attempting to unlock a wider view of human potential.
        However, like the sciences, it must also be mercilessly criticized for
        its understandable but ultimately pathetic half-measures, its ignorant
        lust for “transcendence” or “liberation,” and the tragic violence done
        in its name to this day.
      </p>

      <p>(“We are the universe experiencing itself.” - Alan Watts (pic))</p>

      <p>
        We, amidst the godless, neurotic sense of “progress” and the pathetic
        attempts to hold at bay the profound destruction through “progress” to
        somewhere or “conservation” of something, we stand at an immense end of
        the present moment. As we continue to watch each other, ourselves, and
        the “shared reality” that once held us and our experiences together, let
        us call out to anyone with ears to hear to declare this paradigm of
        disintegration and death as The New-New Age. As we here at Explorations
        go forth and open our mouths to share the Bad News, may our voices be
        absorbed into the encroaching nothingness all around us as we declare,
        “We are not the Universe observing itself, nor simply experiencing
        itself; as the commotion of being gives way to eternal silence, we are
        the universe tolerating, enduring, and destroying itself.”
      </p>

      <p>(“We are the universe enduring itself.” - Leslie (pic))</p>

      <p>
        Now you might be asking, Now what? Well, this is where we, as Explorers,
        are in a tremendous position. I have built this program from the ground
        up based on this reality, that we are enduring in a very real sense, the
        end times. For our Exploration tonight, allow me to ask all of you, “How
        can we leverage our and everything's inevitable end to Truly Become? How
        may we sift through the actively disintegrating fragments of a reality
        we believed to be stable, to find who we are, what we were truly meant
        to become, and live a life, however short, that we've only ever dreamed
        of?
